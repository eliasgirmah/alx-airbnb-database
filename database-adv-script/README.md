- **LEFT JOIN** to retrieve properties and their reviews, including properties without reviews
- **FULL OUTER JOIN** to retrieve users and bookings, even if unmatched
- **Indexing** and **Partitioning** for database performance

## Files:
- `joins_queries.sql` - Contains the SQL queries for the above joins
- `README.md` - Documentation about the project
